# Updated FlatHub V2 Theme from Alexandra Travkina
Edited and updated by **WebCrew** / Andreas Holzer - [net-twin.de](https://net-twin.de/net/NetTwin)

Me and Felix had already fixed the most important bugs, there was a lot to do. Please feel free to give us a **STAR** here on my repository. **STARS** provide incentives to continue doing something for the HumHub community. 

The theme can be used with small restrictions (see issues), but the last few bugs still have to be fixed by someone, so please **clone the repository and help PLEASE**.

You can also help by testing the theme and reporting any bugs or problems.
